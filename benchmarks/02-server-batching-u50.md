Highest sampled value was **3.90 of 4** slots. Note this gauge is llama.cpp's *average* busy slots per decode step, so the number below is the highest average we sampled, not an instantaneous maximum batch width. A peak near 1 means
requests were served one at a time -- either the load was too light to overlap, or
they arrived too far apart. A peak approaching `--parallel` means the scheduler was
genuinely packing concurrent requests into shared decode steps.
`requests_deferred` went above zero: more requests arrived than there were slots, so some waited. That wait is the queue time in your P95.

## My observation

The highest sampled average was 3.90 busy slots per decode step out of four,
so the server was batching overlapping requests. At the same time, four
requests were processing and up to 46 were deferred. The load report's
effective concurrency of 29.3 is larger than four because Little's Law counts
requests waiting in the queue as well as requests using a slot. The server
gauges are the direct evidence for slot use; effective concurrency describes
the whole request system, so the numbers are compatible.
